	shorttitle = {Proximal Gradient Algorithms},
	abstract = {Advances in numerical optimization have supported breakthroughs in several areas of signal processing. This paper focuses on the recent enhanced variants of the proximal gradient numerical optimization algorithm, which combine quasi-Newton methods with forward-adjoint oracles to tackle large-scale problems and reduce the computational burden of many applications. These proximal gradient algorithms are here described in an easy-to-understand way, illustrating how they are able to address a wide variety of problems arising in signal processing. A new high-level modeling language is presented which is used to demonstrate the versatility of the presented algorithms in a series of signal processing application examples such as sparse deconvolution, total variation denoising, audio de-clipping and others.},

	url = {https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00490826},
	abstract = {We study a first-order primal-dual algorithm for convex optimization problems with known saddle-point structure. We prove convergence to a saddle-point with rate O(1/N) in finite dimensions, which is optimal for the complete class of non-smooth problems we are considering in this paper. We further show accelerations of the proposed algorithm to yield optimal rates on easier problems. In particular we show that we can achieve O(1/N²) convergence on problems, where the primal or the dual objective is uniformly convex, and we can show linear convergence, i.e. O(1/e{\textasciicircum}N) on problems where both are uniformly convex. The wide applicability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on several imaging problems such as image denoising, image deconvolution, image inpainting, motion estimation and image segmentation.},

	abstract = {We consider the class of Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithms ({ISTA}) for solving linear inverse problems arising in signal/image processing. This class of methods is attractive due to its simplicity, however, they are also known to converge quite slowly. In this paper we present a Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm ({FISTA}) which preserves the computational simplicity of {ISTA}, but with a global rate of convergence which is proven to be significantly better, both theoretically and practically. Initial promising numerical results for wavelet-based image deblurring demonstrate the capabilities of {FISTA}.},
