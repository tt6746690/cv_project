\section{The Two-Bucket Camera}

\subsection{Notations}

The coded two-bucket (C2B) camera is a pixel-wise coded exposure camera that outputs two images in a single exposure.\cite{weiCodedTwoBucketCameras2018} Each pixel in the sensor has two photo-collecting site, i.e. the two \textit{buckets}, as well as a 1-bit writable memory controlling which bucket is actively collecting light. It was shown previously that C2B camera is capable of one-shot 3D reconstruction by solving a simpler image demosaicing and illumination demultiplexing problem instead of a difficult 3D reconstruction problem. We summarize the following notations relevant to discussion

\subsection{The Forward Model}

\paragraph{Subsampling Mapping}
Let $\bS \in \{1,2,\cdots,F\}^P$ be a vector specifying how the one-frame code tensor $\widetilde{\bC}$ is constructed, i.e. $\tilde{\bc}_1^{p} := \bc_{\bS_p}^p$, for all pixels $p$. We can view $\bS$ as a mask to construct a \textbf{S}ubsampling linear map that maps vectorized two-bucket image sequences $\sI$ to the vectorized illumination mosaics $\bY$. In particular, let $\bB' \in \R^{P\times PF}$ and $\bB \in \R^{2P \times 2PF}$ be defined as follows 
\begin{align*}
    \bB' &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \diag{\mathbbm{1}_{\{1\}}(\bS) } & \diag{\mathbbm{1}_{\{2\}}(\bS) } & \cdots & \diag{\mathbbm{1}_{\{F\}}(\bS) }
    \end{bmatrix} \\
    \bB &=  \bI_2 \otimes \bB' = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \bB' & \mathbf{0} \\
        \mathbf{0} & \bB' \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
Then we have the following relation between $\sI$ and $\bY$,
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:subsampling_relation}
    \vec{\bY} = \bB \vec{\sI}
\end{equation}
In essence, $\bB$ is a linear operator that trade spatial resolution (measures $\frac{1}{F}$ of the pixels for each frame) for temporal resolution (one two-bucket shot instead of acquiring $F$ frames). We can think of a parallel in RGB color imaging, where bayer mosaic trade spatial resolution for spectral resolution. As an example when $F=3$ and $P=4$, the corresponding $\bS$, when reshaped to dimension of a $2\times 2$ image, and single image subsampling linear map $\bB'$ are given by
\[
    \bS = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 2 \\
        2 & 3
    \end{bmatrix}    
    \qquad
    \bB' = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        1& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0 \\
        0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 1& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0 \\
        0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 1& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0 \\
        0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 0& 1 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
\]

\paragraph{Image Formation}
Per-pixel image formation model is
\[
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \bi^p \\ \hat{\bi}^p
    \end{bmatrix}
    = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \bC^p \\ \overline{\bC}^p
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \bl_1 \bt^p \\ \vdots \\ \bl_S \bt^p
    \end{bmatrix}
    = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        \bC^p \\ \overline{\bC}^p
    \end{bmatrix}
    \si^p
\]
If bucket activity is same for all pixels and we use the optimal bucket multiplexing matrix $\bW$, we can write the above linear relationship compactly for all pixels as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:image_formation}
    \sI = \bX \bW^T
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Linear Model} As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:image_formation_schema}, illumination multiplexing and spatial subsampling can be combined to obtain a single linear function that maps images under $S$ different illuminations $\bX$ to the two-bucket images $\bY$. From (\ref{eq:subsampling_relation}) and (\ref{eq:image_formation}), there exists a linear relationship between $\bx$ and $\by$, 
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:linear_mapping}
    \by = \bB \vec{\sI} = \bB \vec{\bX \bW^T} = \bB(\bW \otimes \bI_P) \vec{\bX} = \bA\bx
\end{equation}
where $\bA \in \R^{2P\times SP}$ be a linear map that illumination multiplexes and subsamples $\bX$,
\[
    \bA = \bB(\bW\otimes \bI_P)
\]
and $\bI_P\in\R^{P\times P}$ is identity. 

\subsection{Image Processing Pipeline}
The reconstruction pipeline is as follows
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use $\widetilde{\bC}$ for bucket activities and capture the two-bucket image $\bY$
    \item upsample the images to full resolution images $\sI$
    \item demultiplex $\sI$ to obtain $S$ full resolution images $\bX$ as a least squares solution to a (\ref{eq:image_formation})
    \item use $\bX$ to solve for phase and albedo using ZNCC decoding \cite{mirdehghanOptimalStructuredLight2018}
\end{enumerate}
Step 2 and 3 are critical to downstream reconstuctions. When $S=3,S=4$ and $\bS$ being analogous to bayer mask, we can upsample the images using standard demosaicing algorithms. However, it is not immediately obvious to extend demosaicing methods to support arbitrary $\bS$, or more specifically, for scenarios where the spatial subsampling scheme is not bayer and when number of frames is not 3.
