	abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying the convolutional neural network ({CNN}) to solving the demosaicing problem. The paper presents two {CNN} models that learn end-to-end mappings between the mosaic samples and the original image patches with full information. In the case the Bayer color filter array ({CFA}) is used, an evaluation with ten competitive methods on popular benchmarks confirms that the data-driven, automatically learned features by the {CNN} models are very effective. Experiments show that the proposed {CNN} models can perform equally well in both the {sRGB} space and the linear space. It is also demonstrated that the {CNN} model can perform joint denoising and demosaicing. The {CNN} model is very flexible and can be easily adopted for demosaicing with any {CFA} design. We train {CNN} models for demosaicing with three different {CFAs} and obtain better results than existing methods. With the great flexibility to be coupled with any {CFA}, we present the first data-driven joint optimization of the {CFA} design and the demosaicing method using {CNN}. Experiments show that the combination of the automatically discovered {CFA} pattern and the automatically devised demosaicing method significantly outperforms the current best demosaicing results. Visual comparisons confirm that the proposed methods reduce more visual artifacts than existing methods. Finally, we show that the {CNN} model is also effective for the more general demosaicing problem with spatially varying exposure and color and can be used for taking images of higher dynamic ranges with a single shot. The proposed models and the thorough experiments together demonstrate that {CNN} is an effective and versatile tool for solving the demosaicing problem.},

	abstract = {In digital photography, two image restoration tasks have been studied extensively and resolved independently: demosaicing and super-resolution. Both these tasks are related to resolution limitations of the camera. Performing super-resolution on a demosaiced images simply exacerbates the artifacts introduced by demosaicing. In this paper, we show that such accumulation of errors can be easily averted by jointly performing demosaicing and super-resolution. To this end, we propose a deep residual network for learning an end-to-end mapping between Bayer images and high-resolution images. By training on high-quality samples, our deep residual demosaicing and super-resolution network is able to recover high-quality super-resolved images from low-resolution Bayer mosaics in a single step without producing the artifacts common to such processing when the two operations are done separately. We perform extensive experiments to show that our deep residual network achieves demosaiced and super-resolved images that are superior to the state-of-the-art both qualitatively and in terms of {PSNR} and {SSIM} metrics.},

	abstract = {Demosaicing is an important first step for color image acquisition. For practical reasons, demosaicing algorithms have to be both efficient and yield high quality results in the presence of noise. The demosaicing problem poses several challenges, e.g. zippering and false color artifacts as well as edge blur. In this work, we introduce a novel learning based method that can overcome these challenges. We formulate demosaicing as an image restoration problem and propose to learn efficient regularization inspired by a variational energy minimization framework that can be trained for different sensor layouts. Our algorithm performs joint demosaicing and denoising in close relation to the real physical mosaicing process on a camera sensor. This is achieved by learning a sequence of energy minimization problems composed of a set of {RGB} filters and corresponding activation functions. We evaluate our algorithm on the Microsoft Demosaicing data set in terms of peak signal to noise ratio ({PSNR}) and structured similarity index ({SSIM}). Our algorithm is highly efficient both in image quality and run time. We achieve an improvement of up to 2.6 {dB} over recent state-of-the-art algorithms.},

We introduce a new data-driven approach for these challenges: we train a deep neural network on a large corpus of images instead of using hand-tuned filters. While deep learning has shown great success, its naive application using existing training datasets does not give satisfactory results for our problem because these datasets lack hard cases. To create a better training set, we present metrics to identify difficult patches and techniques for mining community photographs for such patches. Our experiments show that this network and training procedure outperform state-of-the-art both on noisy and noise-free data.

	abstract = {Digital color cameras make sub-sampled measurements of color at alternating pixel locations, and then “demosaick” these measurements to create full color images by up-sampling. This allows traditional cameras with restricted processing hardware to produce color images from a single shot, but it requires blocking a majority of the incident light and is prone to aliasing artifacts. In this paper, we introduce a computational approach to color photography, where the sampling pattern and reconstruction process are co-designed to enhance sharpness and photographic speed. The pattern is made predominantly panchromatic, thus avoiding excessive loss of light and aliasing of high spatial-frequency intensity variations. Color is sampled at a very sparse set of locations and then propagated throughout the image with guidance from the un-aliased luminance channel. Experimental results show that this approach often leads to significant reductions in noise and aliasing artifacts, especially in low-light conditions.},

	abstract = {Image demosaicing is a problem of interpolating full-resolution color images from so-called color-filter-array ({CFA}) samples. Among various {CFA} patterns, Bayer pattern has been the most popular choice and demosaicing of Bayer pattern has attracted renewed interest in recent years partially due to the increased availability of source codes/executables in response to the principle of “reproducible research”. In this article, we provide a systematic survey of over seventy published works in this field since 1999 (complementary to previous reviews 22, 67). Our review attempts to address important issues to demosaicing and identify fundamental differences among competing approaches. Our findings suggest most existing works belong to the class of sequential demosaicing- i.e., luminance channel is interpolated first and then chrominance channels are reconstructed based on recovered luminance information. We report our comparative study results with a collection of eleven competing algorithms whose source codes or executables are provided by the authors. Our comparison is performed on two data sets: Kodak {PhotoCD} (popular choice) and {IMAX} high-quality images (more challenging). While most existing demosaicing algorithms achieve good performance on the Kodak data set, their performance on the {IMAX} one (images with varying-hue and high-saturation edges) degrades significantly. Such observation suggests the importance of properly addressing the issue of mismatch between assumed model and observation data in demosaicing, which calls for further investigation on issues such as model validation, test data selection and performance evaluation.},

	abstract = {Multisampled imaging is a general framework for using pixels on an image detector to simultaneously sample multiple dimensions of imaging (space, time, spectrum, brightness, polarization, etc.). The mosaic of red, green, and blue spectral filters found in most solid-state color cameras is one example of multisampled imaging. We briefly describe how multisampling can be used to explore other dimensions of imaging. Once such an image is captured, smooth reconstructions along the individual dimensions can be obtained using standard interpolation algorithms. Typically, this results in a substantial reduction of resolution (and, hence, image quality). One can extract significantly greater resolution in each dimension by noting that the light fields associated with real scenes have enormous redundancies within them, causing different dimensions to be highly correlated. Hence, multisampled images can be better interpolated using local structural models that are learned offline from a diverse set of training images. The specific type of structural models we use are based on polynomial functions of measured image intensities. They are very effective as well as computationally efficient. We demonstrate the benefits of structural interpolation using three specific applications. These are 1) traditional color imaging with a mosaic of color filters, 2) high dynamic range monochrome imaging using a mosaic of exposure filters, and 3) high dynamic range color imaging using a mosaic of overlapping color and exposure filters.},

This poses a great challenge in obtaining meaningful reconstructions and a special care for the efficient treatment of the problem is required. While there are several machine learning approaches that have been recently introduced to deal with joint image demosaicking-denoising, in this work we propose a novel deep learning architecture which is inspired by powerful classical image regularization methods and large-scale convex optimization techniques. Consequently, our derived network is more transparent and has a clear interpretation compared to alternative competitive deep learning approaches. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our network outperforms any previous approaches on both noisy and noise-free data. This improvement in reconstruction quality is attributed to the principled way we design our network architecture, which also requires fewer trainable parameters than the current state-of-the-art deep network solution. Finally, we show that our network has the ability to generalize well even when it is trained on small datasets, while keeping the overall number of trainable parameters low.},

To facilitate an objective assessment of current methods, we introduce a public ground truth data set of natural images suitable for research in image demosaicing and denoising. We then use this large data set to develop a machine learning approach to demosaicing. Our proposed method addresses both demosaicing challenges by learning a statistical model of images and noise from hundreds of natural images. The resulting model performs simultaneous demosaicing and denoising. We show that the machine learning approach has a number of benefits: 1) the model is trained to directly optimize a user-specified performance measure such as peak signal-to-noise ratio ({PSNR}) or structural similarity; 2) we can handle novel color filter array layouts by retraining the model on such layouts; and 3) it outperforms the previous state-of-the-art, in some setups by 0.7-{dB} {PSNR}, faithfully reconstructing edges, textures, and smooth areas.
