	abstract = {Imaging objects obscured by occluders is a significant challenge for many applications. A camera that could "see around corners" could help improve navigation and mapping capabilities of autonomous vehicles or make search and rescue missions more effective. Time-resolved single-photon imaging systems have recently been demonstrated to record optical information of a scene that can lead to an estimation of the shape and reflectance of objects hidden from the line of sight of a camera. However, existing non-line-of-sight ({NLOS}) reconstruction algorithms have been constrained in the types of light transport effects they model for the hidden scene parts. We introduce a factored {NLOS} light transport representation that accounts for partial occlusions and surface normals. Based on this model, we develop a factorization approach for inverse time-resolved light transport and demonstrate high-fidelity {NLOS} reconstructions for challenging scenes both in simulation and with an experimental {NLOS} imaging system.},

	abstract = {We introduce coded two-bucket (C2B) imaging, a new operating principle for computational sensors with applications in active 3D shape estimation and coded-exposure imaging. A C2B sensor modulates the light arriving at each pixel by controlling which of the pixel’s two “buckets” should integrate it. C2B sensors output two images per video frame—one per bucket—and allow rapid, fully-programmable, per-pixel control of the active bucket. Using these properties as a starting point, we (1) develop an image formation model for these sensors, (2) couple them with programmable light sources to acquire illumination mosaics, i.e., images of a scene under many different illumination conditions whose pixels have been multiplexed and acquired in one shot, and (3) show how to process illumination mosaics to acquire live disparity or normal maps of dynamic scenes at the sensor’s native resolution. We present the ﬁrst experimental demonstration of these capabilities, using a fully-functional C2B camera prototype. Key to this unique prototype is a novel programmable {CMOS} sensor that we designed from the ground up, fabricated and turned into a working system.},
