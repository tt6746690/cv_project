%ZNCC  Normalized cross correlation
%
% M = ZNCC(I1, I2) is the zero-mean normalized cross-correlation between the 
% two equally sized image patches I1 and I2.  The result M is a scalar in
% the interval -1 to 1 that indicates similarity.  A value of 1 indicates 
% identical pixel patterns.
%
% Notes::
% - The ZNCC similarity measure is invariant to affine changes in image
%   intensity (brightness offset and scale).
%
% See also NCC, SAD, SSD, ISIMILARITY.
